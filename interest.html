      <h1 id="sport">Track and Field</h1>
        <p>I love track and field. My older sister did hurdles in middle school and high school. I loved to watch her races. Then I ran in high school. Do you know that feeling in a lot of sports after hours of build up, and your team loses at the last second? Well track is different. Yes, you can have that. But it is both a team and individual sport. With so many events spanning so many different skills, there are often moments of both excitement and pain during a meet. There are multiple events going on at once. A track meet is very exciting.
          <br>
          <br>
        To the right are some inpiring moments of mine. The first video is the womens NCAA final of the 4x400 meter relay in 2017. Oregon had to win in order to win the championship and become the first team to win the triple crown of cross country, indoor and outdoor track championships. As I'm from Oregon, I was thrilled to see them win. Second is Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone setting an incredible world record, and third is Kenneth Rooks winning the 3000 meter steeple chase at last year's USA championships after falling no an early barrier. There could be several more, including other of my favorite athletes like Allyson Felix and Ashton Eaton. These will do for this website, though.

      <h1 id="coaching">Coaching</h1>
         <p>When I was a high school teacher in Las Vegas, Nevada, I had the opportunity to be an assistant coach over long distance in 2015. The following year, I took over as head coach of our track and field team. It was a lot of work, but also gave me great memories and the ability to work with a lot of great student-athletes. Pictured below area  couple of top memories. First, with Johi after he qualified for the state meet in the 800 during his first year doing track. And second, with Joseph and legendary decathlete Ashton Eaton in Washington, DC. The two group pictures are with relay teams. These teams include many of the stars of our program through my five years as head coach. On the women's side was a state champion in the long jump and fourth place finisher at state in the 100 hurdles and triple jump, the fourth fastest woman in the state in the 100 and 200 in her junior year, a two time state placer in the long jump and high jump, and a regional finalist in the shot put and relay mainstay. On the men's side, they had just ran the fastest 4x400 relay for our school in many years. On the team was a regional champion in the long jump, and three multi-regional placers in the 4x200, 4x400, and 4x800 relays and our team's top 400, 800, and 1500 meter runners.</p>

      <h1 id="popular">Popularity</h1>
        <p> Track and Field may not be many people's favorite sport in the United States like mine, but it is popular, for youth participation especially. I noticed while coaching that many athletes from other sports do track to stay in shape or get conditioning. Some realize they're better at track and change priorities. Below is a tableau dashboard that not only explores track participation for the youth in the United States, but also looks at girls participation in sports. One thing I value about track is that it often functions as an equalizer in different ways. Track has become the most popular sport for girls in the United States, hopefully narrowing the gap between sport participation.</p>
