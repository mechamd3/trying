                        <p class="mb-0">I would like to contribute my financial skills to a growing organization. As part of the finance team, I will work to allow the company to execute it's strategy through sound finances in support of that strategy. I am pivoting from my previous career, so with my MBA I will likely start in an analyst role of some kind before moving into management and director positions in the next ten years. I want to be part of an organization I believe in and has a positive impact on its community.</p>

                        <p class="mb-0">As shown in my resume, I spent nine years in education developing several qualitative and technology skills that can translate to my new finance career. Through the highly-acclaimed, two-year BYU MBA program, I gained experience in several finance classes. In one of those, advanced corporate finance, I was the TA in my second year.

                        Heryshey, Pennsylvania is pictured above. Between my two years in the MBA program I was a Graduate Finance Intern at The Hershey Company in Pennsylvania. There I had the great opportunity to get experience in a Fortune 500 company on an impactful project. I worked and developed tools to help sales teams have a better understanding of what can improve the company's financial position with top customers.</p><a href="#home" class="custom">Back Home</a>

                        <p class="mb-0">After teaching and coaching for nine years, one strength I bring to business is being able to tell a story in a way that is understanding and engaging. I also love numbers and the insights that can be drawn from them. I look forward to bringing data to life in a way that can educate and influence key stakeholders as to why certain financial moves or positions should be considered. Through nine years in pubic education, I have showed resiliency, grit, and determination in various work environments.</p>
